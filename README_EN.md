# üí± Currency Converter - Java API Client

This project was developed as part of the **Oracle Next Education (ONE) - LATAM**, where we covered key concepts such as:

- Object-oriented programming in Java

- Consuming external APIs using the GSON library

- Exception handling

- Project structure and configuration file management

**Objective:** Apply these concepts in a real-world use case by consuming an exchange rate API to perform real-time currency conversion from a Java application.

The program presents the conversion from one currency to another, the history of all converted currencies, and a data entry guide for all possible currency combinations.
